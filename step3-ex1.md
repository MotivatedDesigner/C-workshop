the diffrence between [ int main() & int main(int argc,char **argv[]) ],
is that the last one can use arguments passed from the user at run-time
example is this code i write that calculate the nth fibonacci term with three diffrent methods 
specifyed with an option entered by the user & show the result + execution time
